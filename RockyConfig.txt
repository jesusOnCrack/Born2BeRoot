2. leave ONLY 4242 port open

 what is a logical partion. what is a phyusical partition. what is an extended partition.

sudo ->
1. Strict rules:
	1.1. authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts of password insertions
	1.2. custom message prompting after wrong password insertion 
	1.3. each action using sudo has to be archived(inputs and outputs). log files saved in "/var/log/sudo/folder"
	1.4. TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons
	1.5. For security reasons, paths allowed for sudo must be restricted. Ex.: "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"

TTY -> 


user ->
1. set up a user with a username login along with root user belonging to user42 and sudo groups

group ->

monitorinh.sh script Script.png
1. developed in bash
2. at server startup and every 10 min.
3.script will display info:
	3.1. operating system architechture and kernel version
	3.2. number of physical processors
	3.3. number of virtual processors
	3.4. available RAM atm and utilization rate in percentage
	3.5. current utilization rate of processors in percentage
	3.6. date and time of last reboot
	3.7. wether LVM is active or not
	3.8. number of active connections
	3.9. number of users using the server
	3.10. number of users using the server
	3.11. IPv4 address of my server and MAC address
	3.12. number of commands executed with sudo program

After setting up configuration files
1. change all the passwords of the accounts present on the virtual machine, including the root

Checking if the mandatory setup is correct Check.png

############ BONUS ###################

1. get a similar structure to BonusPartitions.png
2. Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services: lighttpd, MariaDB, PHP
2. Set up a service of my choice that is useful (NO NGINX or Apache2)

############# DELIVERY #################
Preparation
1. turn in a signature.txt file at the root of Git repo
2. paste the file in the signature of my machine's virtual disk
	2.1. Open the default installation folder (where VM's are saved) - ~/VirtualBox VMs/
	2.2. Retrieve the signature from the ".vdi" file of your virtual machine in sha1 format -> sha1sum rocky_serv.vdi | output -> 6e657c4619944be17df3c31faa030c25e43e40af
3. VM's signature may be altered after first evaluation -> duplicate the VM or use save state

Defense
1. Create a new user and assign it to a group
2. explain how the script works.
3. interupt script created wihtout editing it
4. take a look at cron
5. MAYBE extra services. Open more ports to suit my needs. Firewalld rules apply
